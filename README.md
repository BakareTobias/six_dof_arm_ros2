Pick and Place Arm(PAP) ROS2
A ROS2 project that models and controls a 7 degree of freedom robotic arm using gazebo and moveit. The project includes support for pick-and-place functionality.

Features
This project includes the following packages:
- pap_arm: urdf descriptions as well as launch file and rviz files for the robot model
- pap_arm_bringup: stores gazebo worlds, as well as launch files for moveit
- pap_arm_moveit_config: config and launch files generated by the moveit setup assistant
- my_robot_interfaces: custom messages designed as input for controlling the messages
- my_robot_commander_cpp: C++ package for controlling the robot in moveit with some in built functions

Requirements
Ubuntu 24.04, ROS2 Jazzy, Gazebo, Moveit, Docker*, Python 3.10, C++17

*Docker is used to run the moveit setup assistant on ROS2 Humble in a containerized manner, due to a bug that causes the Jazzy version to crash spontaenously

Installation
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BakareTobias/pap_arm_ros2.git
cd six_dof_arm_ros2
```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   rosdep update
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```
3. Build and source 
   ```
   colcon build --symlink-install && source ~/.bashrc 
   ```

Usage
1. Launch the robot in rviz
   ``` ros2 launch pap_arm display.launch.xml```
2. Launch the robot with Moveit
   ``` ros2 launch pap_arm_bringup moveit_launch.xml ```
3. Write commands to the robot
   a. Send robot to a named posiion (home, pose_1,pose_2)
     ``` ros2 topic pub /named_target std_msgs/msg/String "{data: pose_1}"```
   b. Give robot a set of joint targets(Forward Kinematics): ensure to provide an array of EXACTLY seven floats to match the seven joints of the robot e.g.
     ``` ros2 topic pub /joint_target my_robot_interfaces/msg/JointTarget "{joint_angles: [0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0]}```
   c. Give robot a goal position and orientation(Inverse Kinematics): ensure to provide minimum SIX values for position and orientation.
      A seventh argument determine if the robot should move to this new goal along a straight path(Cartesian Planning), and it is set to False by default
